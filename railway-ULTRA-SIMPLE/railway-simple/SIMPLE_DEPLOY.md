# 🚀 ULTRA-SIMPLE Railway Deploy

## This Package Contains ONLY 4 Files:

1. **index.html** - Your website
2. **Ace.svg** - Your logo
3. **index.js** - Simplest server possible
4. **package.json** - Minimal config

---

## 📋 Deploy Steps (Delete Everything First!)

### **Step 1: Delete Everything in GitHub**

1. Go to your GitHub repo: `dealers-choice-website`
2. **Delete ALL files** (yes, everything!)
   - Click each file → trash icon → commit

### **Step 2: Upload ONLY These 4 Files**

1. Click **"Add file"** → **"Upload files"**
2. Drag ONLY these files:
   - ✅ index.html
   - ✅ Ace.svg
   - ✅ index.js
   - ✅ package.json
3. Commit changes

### **Step 3: Railway Will Auto-Deploy**

Railway will see:
- ✅ package.json → "Oh, it's Node.js!"
- ✅ "start" script → Run `node index.js`
- ✅ Done!

---

## ✅ What to Expect

**Build logs should show:**
```
✓ Initialization
✓ Build → Installing dependencies
✓ Deploy → Starting with: node index.js
✓ Success!
```

---

## 🆘 If It STILL Fails

**Seriously, use Vercel instead:**

1. Go to: https://vercel.com
2. Login with GitHub
3. New Project → Select your repo
4. Deploy
5. Done in 30 seconds ✅

Railway is being unnecessarily difficult. Vercel "just works" for Node.js apps.

**This is as simple as it gets. If this doesn't work, Railway has issues.** 🤷‍♂️
